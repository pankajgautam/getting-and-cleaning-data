##Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## Solution: 
These libarary were used for this project
```
 library(tidyr)
 library(dplyr)
 library(reshape2)
```
R code is written to create tidy data txt file. Dtaa is downloaded using code with the file name ActRecUsingSmartphones_dataset.zip.   This file is unzipped at set directory. After file is unzipped data from files.The dataset includes the following files:
 
- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.  

Based on above description training and test data frames are created and merged with below code
 
```
# get training dataset
train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")[featuresWanted]
trainActivities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt")
trainSubjects <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
train <- cbind(trainSubjects, trainActivities, train)

#get test data set
test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")[featuresWanted]
testActivities <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt")
testSubjects <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
test <- cbind(testSubjects, testActivities, test)

# merge datasets and add labels
allData <- rbind(train, test)
colnames(allData) <- c("subject", "activity", featuresWanted.names)
```
Below code is create to tiidy data and create a text file tidy.txt with comma as seperator

```
# turn activities & subjects into factors
allData$activity <- factor(allData$activity, levels = activityLabels[,1], labels = activityLabels[,2])
allData$subject <- as.factor(allData$subject)


# sort data to check 
sortedData <- allData %>% arrange(subject,activity)

# This section takes multiple columns and collapses into key-value pair
gatheredData <-
  sortedData %>% gather(key = subject,
                        value = activity)
# renaming column headers
colnames(gatheredData) <- c("subject", "activity", "variable","mean")

# clculating mean from data to create a clean dataset
allData.mean <- dcast(gatheredData, subject + activity ~ variable, mean)

# This section creates a , seperated text file with name tidy.txt
write.table(allData.mean, "tidy.txt", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE,sep = ",")
```
